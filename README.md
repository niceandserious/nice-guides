# Nice Guides

These guides are for keeping track of how we write code. We're aiming for both consistency and best practice, so that we can create clean and sustainable code. With everyone working towards the same style and structure, it makes working together that little bit easier! :dancers:

## General principles

- Consistency of coding style within a project is more important than adhering to any coding standard. If youâ€™re working with an existing project or framework, use its existing style.
- **Comment everything** non-trivial (and even trivial things, if you like). Be clear, and as verbose as you like. Over-commenting is better than under-commenting. Write for your future self as much as anyone else. Ideally, it should be possible to get a good idea of what the code does by reading through the comments alone.
